Description: DXMarkers is a tool designed to read, analyze and annotate cell marker data for specific species and tissues from the CellMarker, CellMarker2.0, and PanglaoDB databases. It allows users to identify variable genes, output them, and annotate cell and gene markers based on multiple databases. The main functions, annotate_markers() and find_variable_genes(), take as input a Seurat object (find_variable_genes) or the top 10 genes CSV file, the species name ('Mouse' or 'Human'), and the tissue class to filter (annotate_markers). It returns a list or a dataframe of the filtered data, which includes the specified markers for the given species and tissue class.
